# Expense Tracker with Lambda Functions

This is a Python-based Expense Tracker application built as part of freeCodeCamp.org's "Learn Lambda Functions by Building an Expense Tracker" project. The project highlights the use of **Lambda Functions** for creating efficient and streamlined operations within your app.

## Features

- **Add Expenses**: Easily log an expense with its amount and category.
- **List All Expenses**: Display a detailed list of all recorded expenses.
- **Calculate Total Expenses**: Get the total amount spent across all categories.
- **Filter Expenses by Category**: View expenses based on specific categories to analyze spending habits.

## Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:
- The power and flexibility of Python's **lambda functions**.
- Using **functional programming** constructs like `map` and `filter`.
- Creating an interactive, menu-driven console application in Python.

## Code Overview

### Key Functions:
1. **`add_expense`**: Adds a new expense to the tracker.
2. **`print_expenses`**: Prints all expenses to the console.
3. **`total_expenses`**: Calculates the total amount of all expenses using a lambda function.
4. **`filter_expenses_by_category`**: Filters expenses by category with the help of a lambda function.

### Main Flow:
The `main` function provides a menu-driven interface for the user to interact with the Expense Tracker application. Users can:
- Add new expenses.
- View a list of all recorded expenses.
- See total expenses.
- Filter expenses by category.
- Exit the program.
